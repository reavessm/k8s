Distfile Cache
==============

This is for setting up a local portage mirror.  
This will include an Nginx proxy as well as persistent storage.  
Client configurations will still need to be done manually, but I might throw up an example config

Next, this server will be set up as a [Binary Package Server](wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_guide) for building and deploying
ARM packages (i.e. RaspberryPis)
